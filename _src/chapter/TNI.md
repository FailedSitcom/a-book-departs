## Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

### What is it?

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) measures how quickly the page responds to user interaction, which is, in fairness, how we could describe basically every aspect of front-end performance.	

### Why does this sound so familiar?

Ah, perhaps because you—like me—have been doing this for a long time.



### How do I measure it?


### How do I fix it?

>When a page responds to an interaction, the result is visual feedback, which is presented by the browser in the next frame the browser presents. Visual feedback tells you if, for example, an item you add to an online shopping cart is indeed being added, whether a mobile navigation menu has opened, if a login form's contents are being authenticated by the server, and so forth.


> The goal of INP is to ensure the time from when a user initiates an interaction until the next frame is painted is as short as possible, for all or most interactions the user makes.

I missed that the brisk 215-page Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability; Accessibility of Web Information and Services of State and Local Government Entities_ “notice of proposed rulemaking” went up a few weeks back; Karen McGrane just tipped me off.

This goes through, we’ll have specific* website accessibility regulations for state and local government websites defined under Title II of the ADA: WCAG 2.1, level AA. Every site where you’re paying fines, renewing ID, registering to vote—_every school district website_—all gonna fall under this.

Now, it should go without saying that accessibility—ensuring real-world access to vital resources—doesn’t really distill down to a tick-the-boxes checklist, and that one should not be prioritizing accessibility strictly due to fear to avoid getting dunked on legal-ways. Nice to have something a little more concrete than “WCAG ^2 AA-ish is how we all have it figured.”

* For sufficiently WCAG-y values of “specific”




> Title II of the ADA provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a State or local government entity.

> The NPRM proposes WCAG Version 2.1, Level AA as the technical standard for web content and mobile apps that state and local governments would be required to follow.
