### What is it?

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) measures how quickly the page responds to user interaction, which is, in fairness, how we could describe basically every aspect of front-end performance.

>When a page responds to an interaction, the result is visual feedback, which is presented by the browser in the next frame the browser presents. Visual feedback tells you if, for example, an item you add to an online shopping cart is indeed being added, whether a mobile navigation menu has opened, if a login form's contents are being authenticated by the server, and so forth.
